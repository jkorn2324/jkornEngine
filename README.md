# jkornEngine

Repository for my Game Engine. Goal for the jkornEngine is to create a Game Engine that can be used
to make 2d & 3d Games with that can be shipped to multiple platforms. For me, the main purpose of this engine is to serve as a resource for me to learn more about how Game Engines, such as Unity & Unreal, work under the hood.

Currently only supports Windows (DirectX11).
